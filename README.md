# IEP Database Project
---

###### Overview
This project is a database for the IEP department at West Carleton Secondary School that tracks personal data for all of the students in the [Individualized Education Plan](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/speced/individu.html) program. This web resource has a few major features, all of which contribute to simplifying the work of the IEP department through introducing electronic means to the management of the IEP program.
See the documentation directory for more information.
The project is written mainly in PHP with some elements of JavaScript. The database also uses AJAX and a MySQL database.
